# nerves_fw_autovalidate controls whether updates are considered valid once
# applied. If set to 0, the user needs to set nerves_fw_validated to 1 in their
# application. If they don't set it before a reboot, then the previous software
# is run. If 1, then no further action needs to be taken.

# nerves_fw_validated is 1 if the current boot selection is accepted It is set
# to 1 here, since this environment is written in the factory, so it is
# implicitly valid.

# nerves_fw_booted is 0 for the first boot and 1 for all reboots after that.
# NOTE: Keep this '0' so that all new boards run a 'saveenv' to exercise the
#       code that writes back to the eMMC early on.

# The nerves initialization logic
#
# The nerves_init code is run at boot (see the last line of the file). It
# checks whether this is a first boot or not. If it's not the first boot, then
# the firmware better be validated or it reverts to running the firmware on
# the opposite partition.
